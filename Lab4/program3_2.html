<!-- 
    Here, we are using the + operator to add two values together: the current accumulator value acc, 
    and the result of the expression (val === 0). The expression (val === 0) evaluates to either 
    true or false, depending on whether the current element val is equal to 0 or not. 
    If val is equal to 0, then (val === 0) will evaluate to true. If val is not equal to 0, 
    then (val === 0) will evaluate to false. In JavaScript, true has a numerical value of 1, 
    and false has a numerical value of 0. So, when we add (val === 0) to the accumulator acc, 
    we are effectively adding either 1 (if the current element is equal to 0) or 0 
    (if the current element is not equal to 0) to the accumulator. Therefore, the reduce() 
    method will iterate over each element in the array, adding either 1 or 0 to 
    the accumulator depending on whether the current element is equal to 0 or not. 
    After iterating over all elements in the array, the final value of the accumulator 
    will be the total count of 0's in the array.
